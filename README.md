# IoS_Dev_OnTheMap

Built by Victor Asselta (aka TomTheToad)

This repository is the fourth project, called On The Map, for the ios Developer Nanodegree from Udacity.com.
The main branch is the master branch. This version is updated for IOS 10.x and Swift 3.

This IOS application is designed for iphones operating in portrait mode.
The challenge was to build and app utilizing several apis provided by Udacity.

The app allows a udacity user to see a map of other users willing to share their location and contribute their own locating as well.

The premise behind the application is to allow Udacity users to show were they are currently studying and see others doing the same.

This application requires an internet connection and will not really function without one.
